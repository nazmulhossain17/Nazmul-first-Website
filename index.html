                <p>For a better professional career, we need better communication skills. Which implies connecting with more people. Building professional communication may seem weakened because of this quarantine. Confidence is a major criterion for building
                    such communication.</p>

                <p>As a Web developer, you want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material, provide interactivity, and be artistically pleasing to the user. In order to do this, you need to know the nuances of Web design and delivery
                    and the various tools and software applications you can use.</p>

            <h1>Mindset</h1>
            <p>Only a handful of organizations actually discuss pay revisions when high performing assets are leaving because of a much better pay. the remaining organizations are happier to pay more money to hire a lateral and replace the position but,
                there is no system to actually discuss pay revision with/for the resigning employee</p>

            <p>The important concepts, such as well-structured application code, efficient algorithms, and knowing when to use particular data structures, translate between languages. To be a particular kind of developer has more to do with deep knowledge
                of the API that you are using. For example, the Windows API has something like 9 trillion methods. Similarly, on the front end, you have to memorize the browser API, HTML and CSS.</p>
